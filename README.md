# Coding_Samples
Coding samples for Pre-Doc applications. I have not uploaded the datasets to replicate each code, but some of them can be replicated easily.

1. Sample_Matlab_Gen_Graphs_Centrality_LP: A matlab code that simulates a DGP using networks and an aggregate factor. It is part of an ongoing project that proposes a new methodology that aims to estimate unobserved networks and aggregate factors jointly. It also compares this methodology to Lasso-type estimators and compares the in and out of sample performance among these methodologies. This code doesn't use any datasets, but it does use some functions that are not uploaded in this repository.

2. Sample_R_panel_bycountry_IRRF: An R code that estimates the interest rate response to fiscal stimulus (IRRF) using local projections. It starts by cleaning the data, generating some variables and finally estimates the IRRF with different specifications. This code is one of the main codes of a paper published on the EER, "Saving Constraints, inequality, and the credit market response to fiscal stimulus". Complete replication files can be found in: https://github.com/cokeconphd/Replication-files-for-Saving-constraints-inequality-...-EER

3. Sample_Stata_FCI_Construction_CL_Hatzius: A Stata code that estimates a Financial Conditions Index (FCI) for Chile with a PCA methodology and some different specifications. Then, it estimates the impact of the FCI on economic activity with simple OLS and quantile regressions. Finally, the out of sample performance of this FCI is estimated. The dataset is not uploaded either.
